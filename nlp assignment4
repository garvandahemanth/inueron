1. Applications of Sequence-to-Sequence, Sequence-to-Vector, and Vector-to-Sequence RNNs
Sequence-to-Sequence RNN: Machine translation (e.g., English to French), speech recognition, text summarization.
Sequence-to-Vector RNN: Sentiment analysis, document classification (turning a sequence of words into a single vector representation).
Vector-to-Sequence RNN: Image captioning (vector to sequence of words), generating a sequence of actions from a single input vector.
2. Why Use Encoderâ€“Decoder RNNs for Automatic Translation?
Encoder-decoder RNNs are preferred over plain sequence-to-sequence RNNs because they allow for variable-length inputs and outputs. The encoder processes the input sequence, compresses it into a fixed-size context vector, and the decoder then generates the output sequence based on this vector, improving translation quality.

3. Combining CNN with RNN for Video Classification
To classify videos, a CNN can first extract spatial features from individual frames, and then an RNN (like an LSTM or GRU) can model the temporal dependencies between frames, allowing for video sequence classification.

4. Advantages of Using dynamic_rnn() vs static_rnn()
dynamic_rnn() dynamically computes the unrolling of the RNN during runtime, enabling support for variable-length sequences, better memory management, and more flexibility. In contrast, static_rnn() requires sequences to have a fixed length.

5. Dealing with Variable-Length Input and Output Sequences
Variable-Length Input Sequences: Use padding to make sequences the same length and mask padded values during computation.
Variable-Length Output Sequences: Use techniques like dynamic decoding or beam search with stop conditions to handle variable-length outputs effectively.
6. Distributing Training and Execution of RNNs Across Multiple GPUs
To distribute training across multiple GPUs, you can use data parallelism, where each GPU processes a subset of the input data and gradients are aggregated. Frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch offer built-in support for multi-GPU training with strategies like DataParallel or MirroredStrategy.
